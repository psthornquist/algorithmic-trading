I found that the original SVM model worked the best using a short window of 4 days and a long window of 100 days. I also used a date offset of 3 months. 

The only model that was more accurate was the Logistic Regression model, which had an accuracy of 0.56, compared to the SVM model's 0.54. I used an 8 month date offset for this model instead of 3 months.
